## Drumpad web app

This was a quick web project that allows for playing sounds by pressing the letters Q, W, E, R, A, S, D and F on the keyboard similar to a drumpad that DJs might use. 

Futher development could include the possibility for the user to upload their own audio files and then play those files.
